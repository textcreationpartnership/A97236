            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving this day ſeene a Letter from LONDON, dated the third of this inſtant <hi>November,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, That there is a Pamphlet printed inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled; <hi>A Declaration of the Earle of</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, <hi>ſhewing a Reſolution to joyne with the Prince if the Treaty take not effect.</hi> I thought my ſelfe bound to take notice of it, having ſo horrid a reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Honour, and wickedly aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing mee with a ſuppoſed Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115961:3"/> ſo repugnant to the Truſt, which I hold under the PARLIAMENT. And therefore I doe hereby declare, That as both Houſes of Parliament have been pleaſed to intruſt me with the Charge of the Fleet, ſo I have endeavoured to improve that Authority committed to me, with a faithfull, and inviolable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto my duty.</p>
            <p>When I firſt undertooke this great Charge, I was really ſenſible how much the Cauſe, Truth, and glory of God, the ſettlement of my Countries Peace, and the preventing of the bloody, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate deſignes of the Enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, depended upon the management of this Expedition, and how much I was obliged in Conſcience and Honour to omit nothing that might have a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to thoſe ends. That Obligation I have (according to my beſt Reaſon and Judgement) faithfully diſcharged, and by the bleſſing of Heaven have received
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115961:3"/> this fruit (notwithſtanding the many obſtructions and difficulties that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervened) that the Honour of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by Sea is cleared, the Fleet commited to my charge preſerved in a condition of Honour and ſafety; The affections of the Sea-men ſetled; the deſigne of thoſe wicked Revolters, that perfidiouſly betrayed ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a part of the Kingdomes Navie broken, and ſuch as aſſociated with them either rendered or reduced (other then thoſe few that for a while have baſely ſheltered themſelves within the Sluce at <hi>Helver,</hi> and one that was out of this Harbour when I came into it.) And as to the pretended Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my joyning with the Prince, in caſe the Treaty ſhould not take effect, falſly charged upon me, by that Pham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, I doe profeſſe, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, who knowes my heart, and waies, that it never entred into my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115961:4"/> thoughts, and that my ſoule abhors it, as inconſiſtent with my Duty, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the Parliament, deſtructive to the Kingdomes Peace, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a free borne Engliſh man; being confident that the Parliament will omit nothing on their part, to make the iſſue of the Treaty (by Gods bleſſing) ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull, and happie. And therefore, as I have hitherto beene faithfull to the Kingdome, and to the Parliament, where I have the Honour to ſit as a Peere, ſo I do and ſhall ſcorne to ſacrifice my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and thoſe publique and deare concernments of my Country, wherein I have a portion, to the miſ-led fancie of any perſon of what ranke, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or condition ſoever; And while I have a heart, and a hand, I ſhall not faile (by Gods aſſiſtance) to have them, on all occaſions, lifted up, for the Service of the Parliament; and common Intereſts of <hi>England,</hi> with my utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115961:4"/> integrity, and to my higheſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; And my actions ſhall confute the lyes and jealouſies as well of that falſe Author, as of any other who (either from an ignorance of my proceedings, or perhaps from a ſenſe, of their owne guilt) dare take the freedome (in theſe times, wherein the Tongue and Preſſe aſſume ſo luxurious a latitude) ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly to beſpatter my Honour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; To vindicate the ſincerity whereof I ſhall commit my ſelfe to him that judgeth righteouſly.</p>
